**AU Individual Healthcare Identifier Profile**  *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This identifier profile defines an Individual Healthcare Identifier[<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/ihi-number/index.html){:target="_blank"} [<sup>[2]</sup>](http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/270101){:target="_blank"} in an Australian context. 

#### Usage Notes

Individual Healthcare Identifier is defined as a 16 digit number. If required, profiles can constrain this profile further to restrict usage to 16 digits only as desired.
Individual Healthcare Identifiers are not used for uniquely identifying patients, they are identifying information that can be used in conjunction with other elements such as name and date of birth appropriately to confirm identity.
