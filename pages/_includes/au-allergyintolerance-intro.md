**AU Base AllergyIntolerance** *[FMM Level [0](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines an allergy intolerance information structure including core localisation concepts for Australia.

Note: The value set [Indicator of Hypersensitivity or Intolerance to Substance](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/indicator-hypersensitivity-intolerance-to-substance-1) is part of a staged approach to offering meaningful localised coding. There is significant redesign occurring in SNOMED CT content relating to allergies, adverse reactions and intolerances. Once the redesign is realised, projected to be 2019, a more focused value set reducing the clinical finding noise will be proposed.

**Examples**

[Ibuprofen allergy, with a manifestation of urticaria](AllergyIntolerance-allergyintolerance-example0.html)

[Self-reported allergy to eggs, with manifestations of hives, nausea and vomiting](AllergyIntolerance-allergyintolerance-example1.html)
