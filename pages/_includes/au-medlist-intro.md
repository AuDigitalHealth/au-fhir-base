This profile defines a list structure including core localisation concepts for use as a medicines list in an Australian context. This profile is intended to offer a common structure and expectations to record, exchange, and fetch a list of medications associated with a patient in an Australian healthcare context. 

Forthcoming work around this profile is expected to result in guidance and additional structures that define types of medication lists, e.g. current medications or medication changes or prescription history.
