**AU Body Height** *[FMM Level [0](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines a body height information structure for use in an Australian context that tightens the [BodyHeightCode](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/bodyweight-definitions.html#Observation.code.coding:bodyheightcode) slice, aligning to the proposed R4 Vital Signs [BodyHeight](http://build.fhir.org/bodyheight.html) profile.

As per the R4 Vital Signs guidance, a separate profile for Body Length is not supported. This observation may be supplemented with an additional coding element containing the LOINC code 8306-3 -*Body height - lying* (i.e., body length - typically used for infants).
