## Introduction
This implementation guide is provided to support the use of FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup>  in an Australian context.

Uses of core resources are described in this guide with common localisation concepts, such as those related to:

* Patient: IHI, Medicare number, indigenous status
* Practitioners: HPI-I, Prescriber number
* Practitioner roles (provider): Provider number, job role
* Organisations: HPI-O, service type, service activity type

Profiles contained in this implementation guide document the structure of some common Australian context concepts. 
This scope is currently addressing general use of these concepts this particularly addresses the need for exchange of this content at a resource level.
The material also can be drawn on as the basis of further sophisticated composed profiles for messages and documents for specific use cases.


This document is a working specification that is expected to be implemented and tested by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers to enable feedback to improve the content of this guide.

FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup>  Connectathons are key to the verification of the guide as being suitable for implementation and this will be supported through various face to face and virtual events.
