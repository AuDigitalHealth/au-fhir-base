Australian Patient Profile

This profile defines a patient administration structure that includes core localisation concepts.

## Identifiers
These definitions represent common data held in the Patient.identifier element.

* __Individual Healthcare Identifier - IHI__ ([METeOR Description](http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/432495))

Each person's Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) is unique within the Australian health care system. The 
IHI is part of the government's e-health initiative developed to enhance the way information is exchanged, shared
and managed in the Australian health sector. Electronic identifiers and the systems underpinning them were
developed and are maintained by Medicare Australia.

* __Medicare Number__ ([METeOR Description](http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/270101))

The Medicare card number should only be collected from persons eligible to receive health services that are
to be funded by the Commonwealth government. The number should be reported to the appropriate government 
agency to reconcile payment for the service provided. The data should not be used by private sector 
organisations for any other purpose unless specifically authorised by law. For example, data linkage 
should not be carried out unless specifically authorised by law.

* __DVA (Department of Veterans' Affairs) Number__ ([METeOR Description](http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/339127))

The data should not be used by private sector organisations for any purpose unless specifically authorised by law. For example, 
private sector organisations should not use the DVA file number for data linking unless specifically authorised by relevant 
privacy legislation.

## Extensions
