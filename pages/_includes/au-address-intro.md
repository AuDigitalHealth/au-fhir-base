Address Profile for Australian Use

This profile provided for use in an Australian context where some constraint on content is desirable to guarantee the quality of a local Australian address whilst still supporting
other uses such as international addresses and unstructured addresses. 

When the **country** element is set to the ISO 3166 two digit code **AU** this explicity asserts an Australian address profile is in use and contraints will be applied to **postalCode** and **state** elements.

#### Examples
