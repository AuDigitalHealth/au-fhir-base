**AU Base Address Profile** *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This profile is provided for use in an Australian context where some constraint on content is desirable to guarantee the quality of an Australian address whilst still supporting
other uses such as unstructured addresses. 

NOTE this profile:
* Is for use when representing an Australian (location) address so country is fixed to AU.
* Is not bound to any elements in this implementation guide directly.
* Overseas addresses can be represented using the core Address data type.
* May be used as needed in implementation guide by use cases.
* Is provided as the best practice guidance on Australian address representation.
